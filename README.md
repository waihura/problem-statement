# problem-statement

Different users of the system would have access rights assigned to them via roles, in such that a sales agent from a specific branch would be able to view only his/her lead inputs under the current branch that they are working under.

A branch manager would have access to all leads and products under his/her branch from all the sales agents input in the system.

So branch managers and sales agent will have access to data in their respective branches based on the access rights given.

This will enable report generation based on branches; 
    -report showing leads under each branch
    -sales agents reports showing their performance
    -lead status under each branch
    -actual sales
